# Identity evidence

[Español](README.es.md) · [Try the demo](https://identidad-360-manueldeasis27-2515s-projects.vercel.app/en/app) · [Case study](https://manueldeasis.com/en/projects/identidad-360) · [Source](https://github.com/mdeasis27/identidad-360)

![Actual interactive local interface](docs/images/cover.png)

Enable fictional sources and introduce conflicts to assemble a local profile.

## Two situations to compare

**Consistent profile:** registry=true, document=true, conflict=false The profile is assembled at 100% coverage.

![Consistent profile](docs/images/scenario-a.png)

**Contradiction:** registry=true, document=true, conflict=true The profile is routed to review.

![Contradiction](docs/images/scenario-b.png)

## Business use case

Sources can agree or conflict.

**Who uses it:** Identity analyst.

**The decision:** Assemble or review.

Gather registry and document evidence, then assemble a profile.

### Try the decision

**Consistent profile:** registry=true, document=true, conflict=false The profile is assembled at 100% coverage.

**Contradiction:** registry=true, document=true, conflict=true The profile is routed to review.

Choose a scenario, edit its controls and run the local computation. Step through the visual process or reveal all steps. Reset before comparing the second scenario.

## How to try it

Open `/en/app` (English, default) or `/es/app` (Spanish). Change the scenario inputs and run the computation. Inspect the resulting decision, evidence and computed trace. Playback reveals completed local steps; it does not measure a live model. Reset starts a new local scenario. Changing language resets the scenario; the interface displays a reset notice.

The primary demo needs no account, API key or database. Public links refer to the existing deployment; local redesign changes are pending publication.

## Local setup and verification

Requires Node.js 22 and pnpm 10.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
pnpm test
node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit --incremental false
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/en/app`. Recorded validation covers tests, lint, TypeScript and production builds. See [command results](docs/quality/decision-lab-verification.json) and [browser component checks](docs/quality/decision-lab-browser.json). The new browser checks exercise real React components and production CSS with controlled locale navigation; they do not certify Next routes or public deployment.

## Architecture

- `app/[lang]/`: localized browser experience.
- `lib/experience/`: typed local adapter, validation and run traces.
- `design-system/`: shared visual tokens, locale controls and execution/replay presentation.
- `app/api/`: optional server integrations; the primary demo does not require them.

Technology: Next.js 16, TypeScript, AI SDK, REST APIs, LLM API, Zod, Tailwind CSS v4.

## Evidence and limitations

Two evidence blocks converge into a profile.

Source provenance, coverage and contradictions; no real identity verification.

Shows coverage and contradictions before a handoff.

**Limits:** Uses local fictional sources only. These portfolio prototypes do not claim measured production impact.

Inputs use fictional or anonymized examples. Optional live integrations require their own credentials and operational setup. Secrets belong in the configured secret manager, never in local secret files or Git. Use the existing `infisical run -- <command>` workflow when live integration is needed. This repository does not publish or deploy automatically as part of the local demo.
